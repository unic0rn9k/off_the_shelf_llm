# Basic off the shelf llm RAG solution ðŸ‘Œ
- Step one: install [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/), which is a very easy and simple package manager.
- Step two: Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download).
- step three: Clone this repository, and run `rye sync` from the root of the project. (This installs all the packages needed to run the notebook)
- Step four: run `rye run jupyter lab RAG.ipynb` to open the notebook

# Easy improvements
- Spell checking in strins in jupyter (so you don't misspell you prompts...)
- LSP for completion of variable names etc
